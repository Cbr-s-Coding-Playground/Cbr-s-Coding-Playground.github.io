# Cbr's Coding Playground - README.md
It's not a coding playground like codepen.io and others.
It's ONLY a coding playground if you summit a pull request if you want something in the
site. However it has to be a request I can understand.
# Template for summiting pull requests.
[The Code]

[optional] <explain what the pull request is about>
I understand that if my pull request did not get accepted, Means that [I] can't do it
or either it's confusing and I might still need to learn how to code
